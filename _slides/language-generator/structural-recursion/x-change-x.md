Say we want to implement a recursive `LinkedIntList.add` method. An iterative algorithm loops through the list to the last element in order to reassign its `next` field to a new `ListNode`.

```java
// post: Appends the given value to the end of the list.
public void add(int value) {
    if (front == null) {
        front = new ListNode(value);
    } else {
        ListNode current = front;
        while (current.next != null) {
            current = current.next;
        }
        current.next = new ListNode(value);
    }
}
```

We can directly translate the iterative algorithm to a recursive algorithm by introducing a `private` helper method.

```java
public void add(int value) {
    if (front == null) {
        front = new ListNode(value);
    } else {
        add(front, value);
    }
}

private void add(ListNode current, int value) {
    if (current.next == null) {
        current.next = new ListNode(value);
    } else {
        add(current.next, value);
    }
}
```

This code works, but the `public` and `private` methods share some redundant code. Both methods include base cases for creating the same `new ListNode(value)` and only differ in assigning to either the `front` of the list or the `current.next`. The `x = change(x)` pattern is a strategy for factoring-out this redundancy.

`x = change(x)`
: A recursive algorithm pattern for factoring out redundant base cases involving assignment of the same value to different fields.

  1. Modify the return type to the type of the desired value.
  1. Define a new base case returning the desired value.
  1. Factor-out redundant code by calling the new base case.
  1. Return a result in all cases that rely on the new return type.

```java
public void add(int value) {
    front = add(front, value);
}

private ListNode add(ListNode current, int value) {
    if (current == null) {
        return new ListNode(value);
    } else {
        current.next = add(current.next, value);
        return current;
    }
}
```

<summary>Why return current in the recursive case?</summary>

The practical reason is to satisfy the Java compiler: the code won't run unless every if-case returns a `ListNode`. By returning `current` back to the caller, the current recursive subproblem is signaling that no change is necessary to the current linked node structure. Remember that each recursive case will reassign `current.next`, but in a long linked list, many of these `next` fields don't need to be changed.

<summary>Why reassign front in the public method?</summary>

Consider the case of an empty list. Since `front == null`, Java will immediately use the base case and return a reference to a new `ListNode` with the given `value`. That new `ListNode` is the new `front` of the list!

The `x = change(x)` concept is something that we might remember from our earlier definition of **functional abstraction**: we're using the return values to help compute the complete result. Formally, we define the **range** as the possible return values of a function.

In recursive algorithm design, there are two ways of communicating between the current recursive problem and its subproblems.

Domain
: The current recursive problem can **send information to its subproblems** by passing them as inputs (parameters).

Range
: The current recursive problem can **receive information from its subproblems** by processing their outputs (return values).

**Runtime analysis** is the process of determining the time complexity of an algorithm.

Like code, complexity is all about communicating ideas about algorithms to others. This communication is most effective when it is (1) simple and (2) easy to compare. Computer scientists follow a three-step process to effectively communicate ideas about time complexity.

Runtime analysis process
: 1. **Understanding** the behavior or implementation details of the algorithm.
  2. **Modeling** the number of steps or operations needed to evaluate an algorithm in terms of the size of the input.
  3. **Formalizing** the result in precise English or mathematical notation.

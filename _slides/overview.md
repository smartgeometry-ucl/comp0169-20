Creative industries such as print, feature films, music, fabrication or interactive media increasingly make use of multiple machine learning driven tools. This module enables students to contribute to a new shift of paradigm, where such tools become increasingly intelligent of the content being designed and the users designing them. This is enabled by machine learning, a new way of dealing with data and new forms of algorithms. We will cover an applied background of machine learning and focus on data structures particularly relevant for creative content such as images and video, and focus on learnable algorithms that allow to machines to process them intelligently, such as convolutional neural networks.
